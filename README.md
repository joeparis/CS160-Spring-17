# CS160 Orientation to Computer Science

CS160 introduces the field of computer science and programming.  It covers binary encoding of data, logic, computer organization, operating systems, programming languages, algorithms, software engineering, and data and file organization.

## Prerequisites

MTH60 Introduction to Algebra with a 'C' or better

Recommended concurrent registration in Math 65 and CS 120

## Outcomes

Upon completion of the course you will be able to:

* Perform conversions between binary, decimal and hexadecimal number systems.
* Demonstrate an understanding of the differences between data types.
* Write and interpret short machine code instructions to perform simple arithmetic computations, including conversion to a negative in two's complement to perform subtraction.
* Describe algorithms in pseudo-code and implement an algorithm to solve a problem in a programming language.
* Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of abstraction and describe the difference between syntax and semantics.
* Summarize the duties and functions of an operating system.

## Class Policies

You will get the most from this class if you attend every day. Much of the material covered won’t be found in the book. A lot of your learning will involve class discussion which can only happen if you are present. 

Students come from many different backgrounds and have unique life experiences which can enhance class discussions. For this reason, it is crucial for students to share their insights on course-related topics. Current issues involving course- and subject-related matters will be very much a part of the class and I encourage you to come to class ready to share new information and ask questions. Students are expected to be prepared for each class, having completed all reading and homework assignments. The course is extremely cumulative so a good start is essential.

While in class, please set your cell phone to *vibrate*. If you need to take a call, please step out of the room to do so. 

## Assignments

### Homework

Homework assignments may include completing designated readings or viewings, individual homework problems, lab activities, and individual or group projects. Homework is designed to enhance your understanding of key concepts and materials. Thoroughly reading, studying, and practicing each assignment is highly recommended.

It is recommended that you use the computers in the labs in McKenzie Hall (MKH-105, MKH-103) or the Library Computer Lab. You are responsible for checking the lab schedule for its hours.

Alternately, you may use your own personal computer provided it has any required software installed.

Late assignments will not be accepted, no exceptions.

Assignments may not be submitted via e-mail.

Written assignments must be word processed and spell- and grammar-checked.

### Quizzes

Quizzes will be given the last class period of each week with the exception of Weeks 1, 9 & 10. 

The lowest quiz score will be dropped.

### Exams

*No midterm or final exams will be given.* Daily quizzes will take the place of the midterm and the two projects below will take the place of the final.

### Programming & Robotics Project

Further details and guidelines for these assignments will be given later in the course.

## Tutors

Tutors are generally available for this and other computer science classes.  Check with the instructor and/or the Learning Center if you feel you need further assistance with this course.

## Assessment

Grades will be determined according to the following schedule:

Type | Weight
---- | -------
Homework | 30%
Quizzes | 30%
Programming Project | 20%
Robotics Project | 20%

| Score | Grade |
| ----- | ----- |
| 90 – 100% | A |
| 80 – 89% | B |
| 70 – 79% | C |
| 60 – 69% | D |
| < 60% | F |

No grades of Y, W, WP or Inc will be given in this class. Remember, if you decide not to complete the course is it *your* responsibility to withdraw from it. It is not the instructor's responsibility to drop you. More information about these grades and how they can impact both your financial aid and your overall progress as a student can be found on the [Academic Standards For Financial Aid page](http://www.linnbenton.edu/current-students/money-matters/financial-aid/academic-standards-for-financial-aid/academic-standards-for-financial-aid-continued).

## Academic Honesty

Helping, or being helped by, another student during an exam will be considered a breach of academic honesty and is grounds for receiving a zero grade and/or failing the course among other possible remedies as outlined in the [Students' Rights and Responsibilities Handbook](https://www.linnbenton.edu/current-students/administration-information/policies/students-rights-responsibilities-and-conduct).

## LBCC Center for Accessibility Resources

The [Center for Accessibility Resources (CFAR)](https://linnbenton.edu/cfar) provides reasonable accommodations, academic adjustments and auxiliary aids to ensure that qualified students with disabilities have access to classes, programs and events at Linn-Benton Community College. Students are responsible for requesting accommodations in a timely manner. To receive appropriate and timely accommodations from LBCC, please give the Center for Accessibility Resources as much advance notice of your disability and specific needs as possible, as certain accommodations such as sign language interpreting take days to weeks to have in place. Contact the Disability Coordinator at Linn-Benton Community College, RCH-105, 6500 Pacific Blvd. SW, Albany, Oregon 97321, Phone 541-917-4789 or via Oregon Telecommunications Relay TTD at 1-800-735-2900 or 1-800-735-1232. LBCC is an equal opportunity educator and employer.
