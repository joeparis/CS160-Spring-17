All assignments must be **typed** using a word processor and submitted via your Google Drive folder by 5:00 pm of the date due. Late assignments are not accepted.

## Assignment 1

Read Section 0.4 Themes of Computer Science, pg 11–16. From pages 16-17 _Social Issues_ choose one of the following questions, 1, 7, 12, or 15, and write two or more paragraphs to answer the question. Type your answer to be turned in and bring a copy of it with you to class. Be prepared to discuss your responses during class.

## Assignment 5

Pg 77-78, _Social Issues_. Choose from questions 1, 3, 5 or 6 and write two or more paragraphs to answer the question. Type your answer to be turned in and be prepared to discuss your answers in class.

## Lab 1

Using the model CPU demonstrated in class, write code using the simple machine language of Chapter 2 and Appendix C to solve the following math problem: `23 – 13 + 17` storing the result in memory location `EE`. Remember that the model CPU uses hexadecimal values so you will need to represent the decimal values in the problem in hex. You will then need to convert the 13 from a positive to a negative number _in your code_ before adding the three numbers together. Hint: you will need to use the logical operators in the simple simultor's instruction set as on step in complementing the value. Turn in a copy of your code with comments that explain your program in English.

## Lab 2

Using the model CPU demonstrated in class write code using the simple machine language of Chapter 2 and Appendix C to solve the following math problem: `(17 + 6) * 8`. Store the result in memory location `BB`. Your code must include a loop and don’t forget to convert the decimal values into hex when writing the code. Turn in a copy of your code with comments explaining your program in English.
